"Getting books from IRC Channels":"<li><div><p style=text-align:left;color:#a480ff><b>Summary:</b></p></li></div> <div> <p style=text-align:left>The mission of #ebooks has always been to have a nice, friendly irc channel for trading ebooks and chatting with others of the same interests. To create a fun loving, helpful environment without the typical amount of rudeness and disdain that seems to pervade the IRC and Newsgroup community.</p><p style=text-align:left> We are located on irc server <b>irc.irchighway.net</b>. The <b>#ebooks</b> channel is primarily for fiction ebooks while its brother channel <b>#bookz</b> on the same network is for tech books, audiobooks and basically all the larger book related files.</p></div><li><div><p style=text-align:left;color:#a480ff><b>Guide:</b></p></div></li><div> <p style=text-align:left> <b>How to set it up?</b></p> <p style=text-align:left>The following guide has been copy/pasted from <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/ target=_blank> <u>Reddit</u></a></p> <p style=text-align:left><b>Question:</b> <i>What do I need to make this happen?</i></p> <p style=text-align:left><b>Answer:</b> <i>A IRC client (I'll be using mIRC for the purposes of this guide, it's the simplest to use and the most widely distributed as well. Besides that, the ability to copy and paste, and a bit of common sense.</i></p> <p style=text-align:left><b><u>📖 Setup 📖</u></b> <p style=text-align:left>1. Now then, to begin, download a IRC client. I personally suggest <a href=http://www.mirc.com/ target=_blank><u>mIRC</u></a>.</p> <p style=text-align:left>2. Once you do that, install it and open the client up. You should be greeted with a page like this:</p><p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/TgSNg47.jpg class=center></p> <p style=text-align:left>3. The first thing you want to do is write in a name that's unique enough to have not already been taken. For the purposes of this guide, I just choose something random.</p> <p style=text-align:left>4. Once that's done, you want to navigate down to &#34;Ignore&#34; section in the DCC options, and turn the box option to &#34;disabled&#34;. This is to ensure that incoming files are not ignored, which is important if you actually want to receive your ebooks. Example:</p><p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/sW0wptQ.jpg class=center></p> <p style=text-align:left>5. Next thing you want to do is scroll back up to the &#34;Servers&#34; tab and pick out a server. For ebooks, I know of two servers that host channels dedicated to ebook downloads. One is &#34;Undernet&#34;, the other is &#34;IRChighway&#34;. While both have their uses, IRChighway is the one you want to use 90% of the time. The selection is generally more robust, the channels are more stable, and the downloads are faster. You generally only want to use Undernet if you can't find the ebook you're looking for on IRChighway. Sometimes you can get lucky and one will have a book if the other does not. In any case, select you server by finding it in the drop down menu and double clicking it. Actually finding and downloading your ebooks</p> <p style=text-align:left>6. Once you've done that, it'll take you back to the menu that I originally showed you. This time, click the connect button, and it'll connect you to the server and open a window offering you a chance to join a channel. Now, there are several channels you can join depending the server you're on. On Undernet, you can either go with &#34;Bookz&#34; or &#34;ebooks&#34;, while on IRChighway, you can join &#34;ebooks&#34;. Type in your channel and hit join.</p> <p style=text-align:left>7. Once you've done that, you'll be presented with a channel window filled with a whole bunch of people typing in seemingly meaningless strings of text, none of them talking to one another. This can be intimidating, but don't worry, it's not hard to figure out! It's at this point that you need to know the commands to properly utilize the channels bots.</p> <p style=text-align:left>8. When you join one of the channels I listed, there will be channel bots you'll use to interact with the bots that you will be downloading from. To access the commands for these bots, use the &#34;@&#34; symbol followed by the command you need.</p> <p style=text-align:left>To search for an ebook, use:</p> <p style=text-align:left> <b>@Search BookName/AuthorName</b> </p> <p style=text-align:left>This will have the channel bot automatically search through it's index and return you a listing of the books available from the download bots in the channel. It will look like this:</p><p> <img src=http://i.imgur.com/hGvcGTg.jpg class=center></p><p style=text-align:left> As you can see, I searched for Romeo & Juliet, and the bot went through its index and returned a list of potential downloads. Click the accept button to have it download.</p> <p style=text-align:left>9. Once you've done that, go into the upper portion of mIRC, click tools, and go to the &#34;received files&#34; drop down. Click it. Example </p> <p style=text-align:left>10. This will open up your mIR downloads folder, which should contain a .zip file of the list of download options that the bot sent you. Extract it and open it up in notepad. There will be a variety of download links available in many different formats. Find whichever book you're looking for, in whichever format you prefer (I like HTML because they're generally the best formatted and the format is universal for mobile devices) and copy the text string up til the the end of the file.</p> <p style=text-align:left>11. Once you've done that, go back to the mIRC channel window and simply paste the text string into the channel.</p> <p style=text-align:left>12. Click enter, and wait for the bot to respond, and then click accept when a file transfer window comes up. I've highlighted my download query, and the bots response with relevant information for you. It should be pretty self explanatory.</p></div>",
